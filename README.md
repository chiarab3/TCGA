# RNA-seq Differential Expression Analysis: Breast Cancer Tumor vs. Normal
# Project Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for a differential expression analysis pipeline comparing breast cancer tumor tissue with matched normal tissue using TCGA-BRCA RNA-seq data. The workflow leverages Bioconductor packages to identify genes with altered expression in cancer and explore their functional significance.
